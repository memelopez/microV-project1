            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
            potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
            mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
            diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
            and drew a double box around it.
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
            hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

              >the first sliver of cosmic time</a
            >
            with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John
            M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
            ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
            <a class="inline-article-link" href="#">gravitational waves</a> —
            the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it
            was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
            old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation,
            proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over.

          <p class="article-text">
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
            accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
            gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
            expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as
            it gets.”
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
            sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
          </p>
          <p class="article-text">
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
            of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
            of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
            surface of the sun.

            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
            Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
            reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
            Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The

                <strong> THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years
                old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a
                sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But
                there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even
                temperature.
              </div>
              <div class="card card-2">
                <strong> NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough
                for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of
                the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time
                for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even
                temperature.

                <strong> DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine
                using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a
                coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
                temperature and how much it has cooled.
              </div>
              <div class="card card-4">
                <strong> COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a
                mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at
                exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see
                a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for
                another explanation.
              </div>
              <div class="card card-5">
                <strong> STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been
                enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they
                get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a
                single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain
                their even temperature.
              </div>
              <div class="card card-6">
                <strong> INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory
                proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big
                Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
                ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew
                into the large-scale structures of the universe.
              </div>
              <div class="card card-7">
                <strong> FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected
                evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized
                light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left
                over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves
                predicted by Einstein.
              </div>
              <div class="card card-8">
                <strong> EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a
                single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to
                an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
                inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth
                and foam of the original pot.
